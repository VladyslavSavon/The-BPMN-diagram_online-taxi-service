A BPMN diagram of an online taxi service

## Short description of the diagram

A BPMN diagram is a specialized type of diagram widely used in business analysis. It is specifically designed for modeling business processes, business rules, user interactions with a system, and interactions between different systems. Unlike other diagrams, BPMN focuses on the internal processes within a system.

This example presents a BPMN diagram for an online taxi service. My goal was to create a simple and easy-to-understand diagram. A common mistake in BPMN modeling is overcomplicating diagrams, making them difficult to read. To avoid this, the diagram includes subprocesses that can be detailed in separate BPMN diagrams.

This approach enhances usability and efficiency, ensuring clear communication with stakeholders and the team. It helps maintain alignment, prevent misunderstandings, and improve workflow coordination.
